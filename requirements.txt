# - Type hints with forward references (TYPE_CHECKING)
# - Dataclasses (though not currently used, available for extension)
# - Enum support
# - Random module for game mechanics

# Optional dependencies for future enhancements:
# pygame>=2.0.0        # For graphical UI
# numpy>=1.19.0        # For efficient board calculations
# networkx>=2.5        # For advanced road network analysis
# flask>=2.0.0         # For web-based multiplayer
